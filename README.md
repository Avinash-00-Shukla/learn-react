# Avinash Shukla's React Learning Projects

A collection of practical React projects built to explore and master modern React concepts, TypeScript, and web development best practices.

##  Projects Included

### 1. **Basic Calculator App**
A fully functional calculator application with:
- Arithmetic operations (addition, subtraction, multiplication, division)
- Keyboard support for seamless calculation input
- Error handling and validation
- Clean, intuitive user interface

**Tech Stack:** React, TypeScript, JavaScript, State Management

**Route:** `/calculator`

### 2. **Weather Dashboard**
A dynamic weather information dashboard featuring:
- Real-time weather data processing
- Integration with external weather APIs
- Interactive dashboard interface
- Responsive design for all device sizes

**Tech Stack:** React, TypeScript, State Management, API Integration

**Route:** `/weather`

### 3. **Projects Grid**
A showcase landing page that displays all available projects with:
- Project cards with descriptions
- Technology tags
- Easy navigation between projects
- Responsive grid layout

**Route:** `/` (Home)

##  Technologies Used

- **React** - UI library for building interactive components
- **TypeScript** - Type-safe JavaScript for better development experience
- **React Router** - Client-side routing between projects
- **CSS** - Styling and responsive design
- **Node.js & npm** - Package management and development tools

##  Getting Started

### Prerequisites
- Node.js (v14 or higher)
- npm or yarn package manager

### Installation

1. Clone or navigate to the project directory:
```bash
cd c:\Projects\learn-react
```

2. Install dependencies:
```bash
npm install
```

### Running the Project

Start the development server:
```bash
npm start
```

The app will open in your browser at [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000). The page automatically reloads when you make changes.

### Running Tests

Launch the test runner in interactive watch mode:
```bash
npm test
```

### Building for Production

Create an optimized production build:
```bash
npm run build
```

The build folder will contain the minified and optimized production-ready files.
